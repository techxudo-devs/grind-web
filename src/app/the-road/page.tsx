    q: "What inspired you to make The Road?",
    a: "Twelve years ago, I made a journey of my own — walking from Greece to Sweden as a refugee. Before I left, I was planning to take the same route shown in the film, but people warned me about a group that tried and never made it. Their story became a cautionary tale passed around quietly, almost forgotten. I never forgot. I promised myself that if I survived, I’d one day turn their journey into a film — not just to honor their memory, but to show the world the kind of invisible suffering that was happening, and continues to happen, in silence.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is The Road based on a true story?",
    a: "Yes. While it’s a fictionalized account, almost every moment in the film is drawn from true experiences shared with me by Syrian refugees. The characters are composites of real people I’ve spoken to, and the emotional core of the story — the sacrifices, the fear, the hope — is entirely real.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the title The Road mean to you?",
    a: "The road is more than just a path from one country to another — it’s a symbol of everything the characters endure. It represents hope, loss, resilience, and the unknown. It’s physical, but also emotional. For many refugees, “the road” becomes a defining chapter in their lives — a test of spirit and survival.",
  },
  {
    q: "How did you manage to shoot in the snow with a small budget?",
    a: "We didn’t use fake snow or studio tricks. Everything you see is natural. We shot in real snow, in freezing temperatures, with a skeleton crew. The cold you see on screen? That was real. We planned meticulously, shot fast, and let the weather become part of the story.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why did you choose to have the characters speak only Arabic?",
    a: "Authenticity. These characters wouldn’t speak English in that situation, and I wasn’t going to sanitize that for the sake of convenience. Subtitles are a small price to pay for emotional truth. Language is part of identity.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do you want audiences to take away from the film?",
    a: "That refugees are not statistics or headlines — they are people with dreams, humor, stubbornness, and deep love. If you cry for Yara, even a little, then you’ve seen the humanity behind the label “refugee.” That’s all I want.",
  },
  {
    q: "What filmmakers influenced your work on The Road?",
    a: "I admire filmmakers like Alejandro G. Iñárritu, who blend intimacy with epic scope, and Denis Villeneuve, whose visual storytelling is deeply immersive and emotionally precise.",
  },
  {
    q: "If you could go back, what would you do differently?",
    a: "I’d give myself more time to rehearse with the actors. We were racing the weather, so we had to dive in fast. But even so, the performances were raw and real.",
  },
  {
    q: "How did you cast the film?",
    a: "I cast a mix of trained actors and newcomers, many of whom had personal connections to refugee experiences. One actor broke down between takes because it was so personal to him.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where do you see yourself after The Road?",
    a: "This film is just the beginning. I want to keep telling stories that matter — stories that walk the line between poetic and political. I’ll bring a hundred stories with me.",
  },

              In the dead of winter 2012, seven Syrian refugees trek through the
              icy forests between Turkey and Bulgaria. Among them is Karim and
              his 12-year-old niece Yara, burning with fever, barely clinging to
              life. With distant dogs barking and border patrols closing in, the
              group battles exhaustion, fear, and the punishing cold as they
              risk everything for the promise of Europe.
              <br />
              <br />
              Tensions rise, and the group splinters—some give up, but Karim
              continues forward, carrying Yara on his back. When the patrols
              close in, panic erupts and the others flee.
